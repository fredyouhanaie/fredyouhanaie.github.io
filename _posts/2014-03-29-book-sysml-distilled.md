Systems Modeling Language (SysML) is a standard specification from
the Object Management Group (OMG) that defines a general-purpose
visual modelling language for systems engineering application.

SysML is based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML). In fact,
formally, it is a profile, or extension, of UML, however, it is
self-contained and does not rely on the UML notation for describing
systems.

The author of the book is a member of the SysML Revision Task Force,
and in several places throughout the book he gives the rationale for
some of the SysML specification design decisions. SysML Distilled was
inspired by Martin Fowler's UML Distilled, and it follows a format
similar to Fowler's book.

The book consists of 12 chapters. Each of the 9 SysML diagram types is
covered in a chapter of its own.

The first two chapters give an overview of Model Based Systems
Engineering (MBSE) and SysML. Delligatti describes MBSE in terms of
the 3 pillars: language, method and tools, with SysML being an
example of the language pillar.  The reader is then introduced to and
given pointers to resources for the other two pillars. Friedenthal's A
Practical Guide to SysML is mentioned in several places as the book to
read for those requiring deeper understanding of the subject matter.

The next nine chapters describe the nine SysML diagram types. The
diagram types that Delligatti considers as more frequently used in
practice are presented first.

The presentation concludes with a chapter on allocations, which is not
a type of diagram, but a set of notations that act as the glue that
connects the various levels of the model to each other.

A hypothetical system, The DellSat-77 Satellite Subsystem, is used as
a running example throughout the book to demonstrate the application
of various diagram types. Each of the example diagrams are defined and
described as part of a hierarchy of diagrams, however, the reader is
kept in suspense until chapter 10, Package Diagrams, where the root of
the hierarchy is introduced.

An appendix, SysML Notation Desktop Reference, provides a handy visual
index of all the language symbols grouped by diagram type. Each symbol
is accompanied with a reference to the section where the symbol is
described.

The latest version of SysML is v1.3(*), however, Delligatti focuses on
the earlier version, v1.2, while covering the differences between the
two versions in the second appendix. The reason for focusing on the
older version is that at the time of writing all the available SysML
tools support v1.2, while only a small portion additionally support
v1.3. In addition, it appears that the use of v1.3 is not as
widespread as v1.2 among practitioners.

In summary, the book provides a good introduction as well as a
practical reference for those interested in using SysML. Overall, the
book is very well written and quite readable.

Although UML is sufficient for those intending to model software
intensive systems, since a software based system is usually part of a
larger non-software system, SysML can be used for modelling the larger
context of the software system. This book is a handy desktop companion
for those interested in the larger context of the system design, and
so is highly recommended.
