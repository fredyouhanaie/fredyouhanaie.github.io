# Introduction

In programming, we often need to swap (exchange) the contents of two
variables, say `x` and `y`. This is normally achieved using a
temporary variable, say `t`, as follows:

```
t := x
x := y
y := t
```

The _XOR swap_ technique achieves the above for binary values without
using a third variable, here $$\oplus$$ is the XOR operation:

* (1) $$x := x \oplus y$$
* (2) $$y := x \oplus y$$
* (3) $$x := x \oplus y$$

I first came across the algorithm (technique) in the mid 80s, and set
about convincing myself how and why it works. My first attempt was to
use a truth table, shown below. The second was to use simple algebra,
which is described in the [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_swap_algorithm#Proof_of_correctness),
so I won't cover it here. Many years later I discovered that the
technique can be explained graphically using a triangle.

The Wikipedia page for [XOR
swap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_swap_algorithm) is very
extensive and covers a lot of ground. Here, I will cover a couple of
additional explanations that are not included on the Wikipedia page.

# Using a truth table

Interestingly, the Wikipedia page, while extensive, does not include
an explanation using a truth table, so here's my version:

| $$x$$ | $$y$$ | (1) $$x$$ | (2) $$y$$ | (3) $$x$$ |
|:-----:|:-----:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| 0     | 0     | 0         | 0         | 0         |
| 0     | 1     | 1         | 0         | 1         |
| 1     | 0     | 1         | 1         | 0         |
| 1     | 1     | 0         | 1         | 1         |
|:-----:|:-----:|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|

In the above, the columns $$x$$ and $$y$$ represent the initial values
of the two variables, and columns (1), (2) and (3) represent the
values of the left hand sides of the three assignments after each of
the respective operations. So, column (2) shows the final value of
$$y$$, which matches the original column for $$x$$, and, column (3)
shows the final value of $$x$$, which matches the original column for
$$y$$.

The truth table above applies to single bit values, however, since the
application of the XOR operation to larger integers is performed
bit-wise, the XOR-swap is valid for integers of any size. Basically,
the same truth table applies to each pair of bits independently.

# The triangle

The XOR operation can be visualized as a triangle with the two
operands at two of the vertices and their exclusive-or at the third.
That is, if $$A$$ and $$B$$ are two arbitrary binary values at two of
the vertices, then $$(A \oplus B)$$ will be at the third vertex.

The most interesting, and useful, property of XOR is that from the
values at any two vertices we can derive the third by applying the XOR
operation to the two values at those vertices. So,

$$A = B \oplus (A \oplus B)$$, and

$$B = A \oplus (A \oplus B)$$.

Now, let's say $$x$$ and $$y$$ have the values $$A$$ and $$B$$,
respectively, then the three assignments will move the two variables
around the triangle one vertex at a time, which will result in $$x$$
and $$y$$ containing the new values $$B$$ and $$A$$, respectively.
