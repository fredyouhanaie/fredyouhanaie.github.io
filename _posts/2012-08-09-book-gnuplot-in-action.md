I have been using Gnuplot on and off since the early nineties. Due to
its simple interface and the online help facility I was able to get by
with all simple plotting tasks, so I never bothered with reading the
manual, and as a result I never learned of its more advanced facilities.
For complex tasks I would instead opt for alternative tools such as
Cern's ROOT software. This book, however, has changed all that, tipping
the balance in favour of Gnuplot.

The four parts of the book, each with 3-5 chapters, take the reader from
a very gentle introduction, to advanced Gnuplot topics, to graphical
analysis techniques. All the chapters are well written, with plenty
of good examples. The largest of the four parts, Advanced Gnuplot, has
dedicated chapters for topics such as 3D plotting and colour, as well
as methods for generating plots, and slideshows, using scripts.

The book is as much about Gnuplot commands and options as it is about
its application to graphical data analysis, although for the latter the
author also refers you to specialist books. With data driven computing
(Big Data) getting more and more attention everyday, this book has its
place on the data analyst's bookshelf.

As with most Manning books, those who buy the printed copy of the book
are automatically entitled to download the electronic e-book versions
free of charge.
